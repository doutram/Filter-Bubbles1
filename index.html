    <h2 class="heading">Take control of your feed.</h2>
    <p class="info-box">This is a hard one but if there is anyone who disagrees with you online dont unfriend them because they have a opinion that differs from yours its a good thing because you both get to see each side of the subject.</p>

      <h2 class="heading">Facebook activity log</h2>
      <p class="info-box">change your activity log to private so noone can see pages you like,
      The reason for this is you need to go and like opposite pages to what you normally like.

      <h1 class="left-title">Step Four</h1>
      <h2 class="heading">Erase browser history</h2>
      <p class="info-box">Now deleting browser history and cookies deletes all the data thats says you are interested in cooking books becuase you was looking at a cooking book on amazon yesterday,
Also Try to use incognito mode theres different names for different browser but this just helps by stoping comapnys collecting data and creating filter bubbles.
